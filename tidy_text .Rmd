```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(viridis)

library(p8105.datasets)

library(tidytext)

```

```{r}
data("rest_inspec")

rest_inspec = 
  rest_inspec %>% 
  filter(grade %in% c("A", "B", "C")) %>% 
  mutate(inspection_num = row_number(),
         boro = str_to_title(boro)) %>% 
  select(inspection_num, boro, grade, score, critical_flag, dba, cuisine_description, zipcode, violation_description)

```


Unnest to get a tidy dataset 

```{r}
## take every element of the word in violation_description out 

inspection_words = 
  rest_inspec %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, violation_description)

```

Let's count some words.

```{r}

data("stop_words")
inspection_words = 
  anti_join(inspection_words, stop_words)
  
```


Count some words...

```{r}

```
